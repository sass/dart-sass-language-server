# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing.

This project is an early proof of concept of a language server for Sass written in Dart to make use of [sass_api](https://pub.dev/packages/sass_api).

Note that the Sass parser currently requires a valid document to generate an AST ([sass/dart-sass#2476](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/2476)),
making it impossible to implement certain features such as completions/IntelliSense.

You are still welcome to test and contribute where you can. Check the documentation and list of open issues to get started:
